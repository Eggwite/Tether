Tether is a lightweight, low-latency service that streams Discord presence and activity data to your apps.
It removes the friction of talking directly to Discord's gateway and returns a predictable, minimal data model
that fits dashboards, community pages, and real-time experiences.

<Callout type="idea">
Client apps often reimplement the same logic to parse and normalise presence data.
Tether centralises that work into a single service so *you* can focus on building experiences.

	<Card icon={<AudioWaveform />} title="Why Tether?" >
		Streams real-time presence and normalises Discord's inconsistent payloads so your frontend receives stable, **production-ready** data.
	</Card>

	<Card icon={<Users />} title="So who's it for?" >
		**You!** Dashboard creators, community sites, streaming overlays, or for portfolio websites.
	</Card>

	<Card icon={<Pyramid />} title="Design">
		Minimal response shape, fewer surprise fields, and clear guarantees - built to behave predictably in production.
	</Card>

	<Card icon={<Blocks />} title="Integrations">
		Works with simple HTTP snapshots or a real-time WebSocket stream depending on the needs of your app.
