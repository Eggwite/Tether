title: API Versioning
---


<Callout title="Warning: Unstable API" type="error">
This project is under **active development**. Even within `v1`, breaking changes may occur at any time until a stable release is announced. This notice will be removed once the API is considered stable. You should be able to trust most fields to remain stable, but be prepared for possible changes.
</Callout>

---

## Versioning Scheme


The API uses URL-based versioning with the `v1` prefix. All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1/`.

```http
GET /v1/users/{userID}
```


---

### Version History

| Version | Status  | Highlights                                 |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| v1      | Current | REST API, WebSocket gateway, documentation |


```http
GET /v1/users/{userID}
```


---


<Callout title="Stability" type="tip">
Within a major version (e.g. `v1`), breaking changes are not made. New fields may be added, but existing fields and error shapes remain stable.
</Callout>

---


## Versioning & Compatibility

- Major version in URL (e.g. `/v1/`).
- Minor/patch releases are non-breaking.
- Breaking changes only in new major versions (v2, v3, ...).
- Deprecated endpoints: marked in docs, supported for at least 6 months.

---


## Upgrading

When upgrading to a new major version:

- Review the changelog and release notes.
- Update clients to ignore unknown fields.
- Ensure error handling supports the canonical envelope.

---


## Guarantees

- New fields may be added at any time.
- Fields are only removed/renamed in major versions.
- Error format: see [Error Codes](./errors).

---


## Release Cadence

No strict schedule. Patch/minor updates as needed; major versions only for breaking changes.

---

## Release Tagging (CI)

The repository's GitHub Actions workflow for publishing Docker images expects semantic version tags of the form `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (for example `v1.0.0`). The workflow at `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` matches tags using the pattern `v*.*.*` and uses `docker/metadata-action` to generate image tags from the semver components (`{{version}}`, `{{major}}.{{minor}}`, and `{{major}}`).

The metadata action therefore produces image tags like `1.0.0`, `1.0`, and `1` derived from the Git tag, followed by a `latest` tag that always points to the most recent semver release. API URLs continue to use `/v1/`; the `/v1/` prefix is the stable major version regardless of what the `latest` Docker image is (for example, a `v1.9.12` release can coincide with the `latest` image).

Examples:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "V1.0.0 release"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Lightweight tags such as `v1` do not match the `v*.*.*` pattern and will not trigger the Docker publish workflow.
