## [`1.0.0`] - 17 Dec 2025

<Callout title="Initial Release" type="tip">
Tether v1 is the first public release: a small Go service with minimal runtime requirements that exposes Discord presence over a REST+WebSocket API. It requires no external services by default (for example, Redis is optional).
</Callout>

### Highlights

- Fast, in-memory presence store for low-latency reads
- Lanyard-compatible REST shape with enriched fields (avatars, Spotify metadata)
- WebSocket gateway with lightweight opcode protocol for live updates
- Small footprint and easy deploy — runs without Redis by default

### Added
- Documented necessary API endpoints and WebSocket gateway protocol
- `GET /v1/users/{userID}` — Fetch presence snapshot for a user (Lanyard-compatible)
- `GET /healthz` — Readiness probe
- WebSocket gateway at `/socket` — subscribe to live presence updates via opcodes
- Basic runtime metrics accessible via admin commands

### Notes & Upgrade

If you depend on the REST shape, note that error responses now follow a canonical envelope with `success: false` and a full `error` object containing `code`, `message`, `status`, `retryable` and optional `details`.

Example:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
        "message": "User is not being monitored by Tether",
        "status": 404,
        "retryable": false,
        "details": null
    }
}
```

If you upgrade from an earlier internal build, verify clients that rely on raw presence shapes. The public interface is stable but I tightened some validation and error formats.
