I built Tether so you don't have to parse and normalise gateway noise in every app.
Let the service do the heavy lifting, and ship features faster.

# Quickstart
First off, we to observe a user we need their Discord user ID. You can get this by right clicking a user in Discord and selecting "Copy ID".

<Callout title="Having trouble?" type="warn">
Not seeing "`Copy ID`"? Make sure you have <u>Enabled Developer Mode</u> in Discord's `user settings`.

Head to `User Settings > Advanced` and enable `Developer Mode`
