<Callout title="Info" type="info">
All HTTP endpoints are rate limited per IP address to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.
</Callout>

| Limit Type            | Value                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Requests per second   | `10`                                        |
| Burst capacity         | `10`                                        |
| Exceeding behavior     | HTTP `429` (Too Many Requests)             |

### Rate Limit Headers

When rate limited, the response includes these headers:

| Header                 | Description                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Retry-After`            | Seconds to wait before retrying              |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`      | Maximum requests per second                  |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining`  | Remaining requests (0 when limited)          |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`      | Unix timestamp when limit resets             |

<Callout title="Example: Rate Limited Response" type="idea">

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 1
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1703123456

{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMITED",
    "message": "Too Many Requests",
    "status": 429,
    "retryable": true,
    "details": null
  }
}
```
</Callout>

## WebSocket Gateway

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
The WebSocket gateway does not have explicit rate limits, but requires proper heartbeat timing. Connections that miss heartbeats will be closed.
</Callout>

## Implementation Details

- Rate limiting uses a token bucket algorithm.
- Per-IP limiters are cleaned up after 3 minutes of inactivity.
