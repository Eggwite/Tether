# Privacy Policy

Tether is designed to be a fully public API for presence data. I take privacy seriously and want to be transparent about what information is (and isn't) collected or stored.

## What I Collect

- **No personal information is required or stored.**
- **No authentication, email, or account registration is needed.**
- **No Discord tokens, passwords, or sensitive data are ever collected.**
- **No user profiles or direct identifiers are stored.**

The only data that may be logged is:

- **IP addresses**: Like most web services, basic access logs may include your IP address. These logs are used solely for operational and security purposes (e.g., rate limiting, abuse prevention) and are not linked to any user identity or used for tracking.
- **API usage metrics**: I may collect anonymous, aggregate statistics about API usage (such as request counts, error rates, and endpoint popularity) to improve the service.

## What I Don't Collect

- No names, emails, or other personally identifying information (PII)
- No OAuth or Discord login
- No cookies or tracking scripts
- No advertising or analytics trackers

## Data Retention

- Access logs are rotated and deleted regularly.
- No persistent user data is kept.

## Public API

Tether is a public API. All data returned by the API is intended to be public and is sourced from Discord presence events. There is no authentication or private user data.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about privacy, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Eggwite/tether) or reach out in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ff5FfJzq).
