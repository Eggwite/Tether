Tether is a lightweight, low-latency service that streams Discord presence and activity data to your apps.
It removes the friction of talking directly to Discord's gateway and returns a predictable, minimal data model
that fits dashboards, community pages, and real-time experiences.

<Callout type="idea">
I built Tether so you don't have to parse and normalise gateway noise in every app.
Let the service do the heavy lifting, and ship features faster.
